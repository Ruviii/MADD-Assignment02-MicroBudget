## 🎯 The Problem

Managing personal finances is challenging in today's fast-paced world. Traditional budgeting apps often:

- 📊 **Lack Predictive Insights** - They tell you where your money went, not where it's going
- 🔒 **Compromise Privacy** - Require bank account linking and send data to external servers
- 🧩 **Overcomplicate Simple Tasks** - Too many features make basic budgeting difficult
- 📱 **Ignore Modern Design** - Outdated interfaces that don't leverage iOS capabilities

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### 1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
Every feature serves a clear purpose. No bloat, no confusion, just essential budgeting tools.

### 2. **Visual Before Numerical**
Colors, icons, and charts make financial data instantly understandable without reading numbers.

### 3. **Proactive Not Reactive**
ML predictions help you make decisions before money leaves your wallet, not just track where it went.

### 4. **Opinionated Defaults**
The envelope budgeting method is proven to work. We make it the core experience without compromising flexibility.
